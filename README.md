# Restaurant Customer Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of 1500 restaurant customers to understand factors influencing customer satisfaction. The dataset includes demographic information, dining habits, ratings, and spending behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following key columns:
- Customer demographics: `Age`, `Gender`, `Income`
- Visit patterns: `VisitFrequency`, `TimeOfVisit`, `GroupSize`, `DiningOccasion`, `MealType`
- Preferences & behavior: `PreferredCuisine`, `OnlineReservation`, `DeliveryOrder`, `LoyaltyProgramMember`
- Ratings: `ServiceRating`, `FoodRating`, `AmbianceRating`, `HighSatisfaction`
- Spending: `AverageSpend`
- Experience: `WaitTime`

## Insights
- Customers who visit more frequently and are members of the loyalty program are generally more satisfied.
- Online reservation users also show higher satisfaction levels.
- High wait times negatively impact customer satisfaction.
- Popular cuisines and dining occasions can guide targeted promotions.

## Visualization with Tableau
The project includes visualizations such as:
- **Bar charts**: Satisfaction by `PreferredCuisine` and `DiningOccasion`
- **Scatter plots**: `AverageSpend` vs. `HighSatisfaction`, `WaitTime` vs. `HighSatisfaction`
- **Heatmaps**: Ratings distribution across different meal types and demographics

## How to Use
1. Open the Tableau workbook (`.twb` or `.twbx`) in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
2. Explore the dashboards and visualizations to understand customer satisfaction trends.
3. Use filters to analyze specific segments like cuisine, age, or visit frequency.

## Conclusion
This analysis helps restaurant managers identify key drivers of satisfaction and areas for improvement to enhance the overall dining experience and revenue.
